    After registering, clients connect to unused (``dark'') addresses that pass
        by a cooperating ISP proxy station. The station communicates with the client
        as if it were a host at the particular address. To the censor, this
        communication appears to be a legitimate connection to a real host,
        making it difficult to distinguish from real hosts and block.
